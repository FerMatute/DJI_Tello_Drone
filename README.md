## Description:

DroneControl is a Python-based project designed to provide comprehensive control over drones, including keyboard-based navigation, object detection, trajectory following, path identification, and more. By utilizing advanced libraries such as OpenCV, the project transforms drone control into an engaging and interactive experience.
## Problem:

Controlling drones with advanced functionalities such as object detection, trajectory following, and path identification can be complex, particularly for beginners. DroneControl addresses this challenge by providing a robust Python codebase that integrates seamlessly with DJI Tello drones, offering powerful drone control and computer vision capabilities.
## Tools:

  Python: The primary programming language for the project.
  
  OpenCV: For advanced computer vision tasks such as object detection and path identification.
  
  DJI Tello: For interfacing with DJI Tello drones and executing commands.
  
  Filters and Algorithms: For processing drone camera feeds, stabilizing footage, and applying various effects used with OpenCV.
  
  Libraries: Utilization of DJITelloPy library for enhanced functionality.

## Functionality:

Users can control the drone using keyboard code, allowing for takeoff, landing, and various maneuvers. The project connects directly to the drone, providing real-time control and feedback.

Advanced OpenCV integration enables real-time object detection and trajectory following. Users can specify paths for the drone to follow, and the code utilizes computer vision algorithms to guide the drone accurately along the defined path.

The codebase allows users to apply various filters and effects to the live camera feed, such as edge detection or color adjustments, enhancing the visual experience. Real-time data visualization, such as speed, altitude, and battery life, can also be displayed through the code.

DroneControl offers a comprehensive and immersive drone control experience. By leveraging Python and OpenCV, the project makes advanced drone functionalities accessible and easy to use for drone enthusiasts and beginners alike.
